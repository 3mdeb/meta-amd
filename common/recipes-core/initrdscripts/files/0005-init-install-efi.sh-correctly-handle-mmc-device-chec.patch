Subject: [PATCH] init-install-efi.sh: correctly handle mmc device check

The cleanup in 68d8f6d2 did not update the mmc device
checking code to generate prefix and other required
bits which makes the installation to fail as it
does not generate correct partition names.
The check is now updated to handle that accordingly.
