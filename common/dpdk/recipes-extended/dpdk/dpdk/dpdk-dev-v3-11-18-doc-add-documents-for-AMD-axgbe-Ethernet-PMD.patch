+
+AXGBE Poll Mode Driver
+======================
+
+The AXGBE poll mode driver library (**librte_pmd_axgbe**) implements support
+for AMD 10 Gbps family of adapters. It is compiled and tested in standard linux distro like Ubuntu.
+
+Supported Features
+------------------
+
+AXGBE PMD has support for:
+
+- Base L2 features
+- TSS (Transmit Side Scaling)
+- RSS (Receive Side Scaling)
+- Checksum offload
+- Jumbo Frame upto 9K
+
+
+Supported Chipsets and NICs
+---------------------------
+- AMD 10 Gigabit Ethernet Controller
+
+
+Configuration Information
+-------------------------
+
+The following options can be modified in the ``.config`` file. Please note that
+enabling debugging options may affect system performance.
+
+- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_AXGBE_PMD`` (default **n**)
+
+  Toggle compilation of axgbe driver. To use axgbe PMD set this config parameter
+  to 'y'.
+
+- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_AXGBE_DEBUG_INIT`` (default **n**)
+
+  Toggle display of initialization related messages.
+
+
+Building DPDK
+-------------
+
+See the :ref:`DPDK Getting Started Guide for Linux <linux_gsg>` for
+instructions on how to build DPDK.
+
+By default the AXGBE PMD library will be built into the DPDK library.
+
+For configuring and using UIO frameworks, please also refer :ref:`the
+documentation that comes with DPDK suite <linux_gsg>`.
+
+
+Prerequisites and Pre-conditions
+--------------------------------
+- Prepare the system as recommended by DPDK suite.
+
+- AXGBE PMD works only with legacy interrupts, so load igb_uio module in legacy interrupt mode
+  using module params.
+
+- Bind the intended AMD device to igb_uio module.
+
+Now system is ready to run DPDK application.
+
+
+Usage Example
+-------------
+
+Refer to the document :ref:`compiling and testing a PMD for a NIC <pmd_build_and_test>`
+for details.
+
+Example output:
+
+.. code-block:: console
