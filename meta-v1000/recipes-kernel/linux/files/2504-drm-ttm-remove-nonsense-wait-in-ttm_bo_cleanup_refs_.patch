Subject: [PATCH 2504/2831] drm/ttm: remove nonsense wait in
 ttm_bo_cleanup_refs_and_unlock
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

With shared reservation objects the assumption that no fence
could have been added isn't true any more.

Additional to that the BO is about to be destroyed, so removing the
fences now has no advantage whatsoever.
