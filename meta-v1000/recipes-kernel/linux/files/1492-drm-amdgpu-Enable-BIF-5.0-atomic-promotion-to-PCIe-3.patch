Subject: [PATCH 1492/1722] drm/amdgpu: Enable BIF 5.0 atomic promotion to PCIe
 3.0 AtomicOps

Atomic operations to system memory are normally dropped by the BIF.
Some PCIe 3.0 platforms support atomic routing to the host for execution
by the CPU. To use this feature, atomic requests must be enabled in the
GPU's PCIe configuration space.

This is a no-op on platforms which cannot route the atomic request to
the host. In this instance, atomics would be dropped with or without
this change.
