Subject: [PATCH 3/4] init-install-efi.sh: Strip partition number from
 live_dev_name

This is needed in case the boot disk was created with mkdiskimage.
In that case the parameter passed is a variant of /dev/sda4 which
includes the partition number.  Without this change this install script
will offer to install onto the live media.
