Subject: [PATCH 1928/2094] drm/amdkfd: Preempt static queues on eviction

Eviction needs to preempt all queues, including static queues.
Processes in the GPU debugger will cause VM faults on evictions.

This has potential side effects for the GPU debugger, and may not
work at all for queues that have halted waves. A better solution
is needed to ensure seamless preemption with the GPU debugger.
