Subject: [PATCH 1360/1722] drm/amdgpu: fix sched fence slab teardown
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

To free fences, call_rcu() is used, which calls amd_sched_fence_free()
after a grace period. During teardown, there is no guarantee all
callbacks have finished, so sched_fence_slab may be destroyed before
all fences have been freed. If we are lucky, this results in some slab
warnings, if not, we get a crash in one of rcu threads because callback
is called after amdgpu has already been unloaded.

Fix it with a rcu_barrier().

Fixes: 189e0fb76304 ("drm/amdgpu: RCU protected amd_sched_fence_release")
