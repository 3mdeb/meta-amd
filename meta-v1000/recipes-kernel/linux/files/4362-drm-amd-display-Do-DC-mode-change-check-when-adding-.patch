Subject: [PATCH 4362/5855] drm/amd/display: Do DC mode-change check when
 adding CRTCs

Within atomic check, dm_update_crtcs_state is called twice. First to
remove from the dc_state, and subsequently to add to it.

In both calls, a secondary mode-change check is done using dc-level
states. We shouldn't be doing this while removing, since a new
dc_stream_state has not been created to do the necessary comparison.
Because of this, the mode_changed flag within the DRM state can be
mistakenly set to false. Doing so only when adding prevents this.

We are also guaranteed that a call to add will come after remove, or
else the atomic check fails (and a commit will not happen).
