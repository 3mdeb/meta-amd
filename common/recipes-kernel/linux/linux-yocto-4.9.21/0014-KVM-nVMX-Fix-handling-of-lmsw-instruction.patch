Subject: [PATCH 14/93] KVM: nVMX: Fix handling of lmsw instruction
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ Upstream commit e1d39b17e044e8ae819827810d87d809ba5f58c0 ]

The decision whether or not to exit from L2 to L1 on an lmsw instruction is
based on bogus values: instead of using the information encoded within the
exit qualification, it uses the data also used for the mov-to-cr
instruction, which boils down to using whatever is in %eax at that point.

Use the correct values instead.

Without this fix, an L1 may not get notified when a 32-bit Linux L2
switches its secondary CPUs to protected mode; the L1 is only notified on
the next modification of CR0. This short time window poses a problem, when
there is some other reason to exit to L1 in between. Then, L2 will be
resumed in real mode and chaos ensues.
