Subject: [PATCH 3323/5855] platform/x86: wmi: Call acpi_wmi_init() later

commit 98b8e4e5c17bf87c1b18ed929472051dab39878c upstream.

Calling acpi_wmi_init() at the subsys_initcall() level causes ordering
issues to appear on some systems and they are difficult to reproduce,
because there is no guaranteed ordering between subsys_initcall()
calls, so they may occur in different orders on different systems.

In particular, commit 86d9f48534e8 (mm/slab: fix kmemcg cache
creation delayed issue) exposed one of these issues where genl_init()
and acpi_wmi_init() are both called at the same initcall level, but
the former must run before the latter so as to avoid a NULL pointer
dereference.

For this reason, move the acpi_wmi_init() invocation to the
initcall_sync level which should still be early enough for things
to work correctly in the WMI land.
