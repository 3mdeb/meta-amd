+/* Surface update type is used by dc_update_surfaces_and_stream

+ * on parameters passed in and decides how much programming (or updating) is
+ * going to be done during the call.
+ *
+ * UPDATE_TYPE_FAST is used for really fast updates that do not require much
+ * logical calculations or hardware register programming. This update MUST be
+ * ISR safe on windows. Currently fast update will only be used to flip surface
+ * address.
+ *
+ * UPDATE_TYPE_MED is used for slower updates which require significant hw
+ * re-programming however do not affect bandwidth consumption or clock
+ * requirements. At present, this is the level at which front end updates
+ * that do not require us to run bw_calcs happen. These are in/out transfer func
+ * updates, viewport offset changes, recout size changes and pixel depth changes.
+ * This update can be done at ISR, but we want to minimize how often this happens.
+ *
+ * UPDATE_TYPE_FULL is slow. Really slow. This requires us to recalculate our
+ * bandwidth and clocks, possibly rearrange some pipes and reprogram anything front
+ * end related. Any time viewport dimensions, recout dimensions, scaling ratios or
+ * gamma need to be adjusted or pipe needs to be turned on (or disconnected) we do
+ * a full update. This cannot be done at ISR level and should be a rare event.
+ * Unless someone is stress testing mpo enter/exit, playing with colour or adjusting
+ * underscan we don't expect to see this call at all.
